                    NO. Energy Meter is an equipment which is used to measure customer electricity consumption.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The customer does not pay for the energy meter. The meter becomes TANESCO’s property all the time.
                    Customer pays only for other installation charges and a little amount as meter deposit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Thus why when energy meter become defective for any reason which is not caused by a customer,
                    TANESCO will replace it at her cost as it is her equipment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    TANESCO customer is responsible for equipment which are beyond the energy meter if found
                    malfunctioning, that is why even some electrical installation personnel is not allowed to service or
                    touch the energy meter or break the seals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The moment an energy meter is installed, it cannot be shifted from one point to another unless it is
                    within one plot and it is done by TANESCO upon customer’s special request.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you spot any anomalies at our energy meter or any equipment from the meter to the pole, please
                    inform TANESCO immediately and we will attend the problem at no cost.
